# Text Summarizer

This Python program summarizes a given text file using the `nltk` library for natural language processing, `string` for text manipulation, and `heapq` to extract the most significant sentences from the text.

## Requirements

Before using this program, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install nltk


### Steps to add the `README.md` to your GitHub repository:

1. **Create the file**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on `Add file` > `Create new file`.
   - Name the file `README.md`.
   
2. **Paste the content**:
   - Copy the content above and paste it into the `README.md` file.

3. **Commit the changes**:
   - After pasting the content, scroll down, provide a commit message (e.g., "Initial commit with README"), and then click `Commit new file`.

Once this is done, your GitHub repository will have a `README.md` file explaining the purpose, usage, and setup instructions for the Text Summarizer program.
